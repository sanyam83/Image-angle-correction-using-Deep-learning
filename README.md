This code corrects the orientation or angle of images to make it upright using CNN and OpenCV.

[GoogleStreet View](http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/GMCP_Geolocalization/) dataset is used for training. 

ResNet-50 model is used with Softmax function for prediction.

Output is angle of Rotation and Corrected image.

Weights' link given in the .ipynb notebook, Trained model for 25 epochs , with pretty good results i.e. 1.7 validation loss and 2.4 Validation Angle error.

Refer to .ipynb file for clear understanding.
